Development of an advanced support robot lie at the intersection of robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on service robotics for humanitarian purposes. Robot mobility systems, vision input, and detections to locate and extract trapped individuals in challenging environments and also with ground robots. These features enable the robot to effectively detect, locate, and rescue individuals trapped in challenging conditions. The thermal sensor array facilitates precise detection of heat signatures, while the robotic arm offers versatile manipulation capabilities for debris clearance and assistance too.
